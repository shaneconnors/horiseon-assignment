Horiseon Project 

This repository includes a cleaned up version of an all ready existing code. 

I personal enjoyed working on this project because I've always had a passion for public relations in the business world. The best companies in the world are built on a solid online reputation. I think this website aims to permote the importance of SEO and social media management. I built this project becuase I wanted to help improve these factors. Social media marketing presence is stronger than ever and will continue to grow in years to come. This application speeds up work productivity through inbound startegy by creating valuable content that matche sthe needs of your target audiences and inspires long-term customer realtionships.

Working on this project I learned the importance of an online presence for any company to survive and thrive in todays world. On the coding side of the project I found that the CSS needed to made more efficent by consolidating selectors and there was also HTml elements not in sequential order. After fixing that I found the code now easeir to read and more accesible.
